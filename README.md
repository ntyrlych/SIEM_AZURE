# SIEM_AZURE
SCRIPT
In this tutorial, I'll be describing the process of setting up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) as well as a Virtual Machine (VM) in the cloud which will function as a honeypot. This honeypot will be vulnerable to the internet, and we will be monitoring and logging attacks from different IP addresses from various countries around the world. We will then take that data and display it on a map so we can visually see where the attacks are coming from. The logging attacks will consist of failed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logins.
